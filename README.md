# Intel 8080 Assembly Language Support in Atom

Adds language support for Intel 8080 assembly to the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io). This is useful for writing code for the Altair 8800 or machine running the CP/M operating system.

This package contains the mnemonics for the [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080) microprocessor. It supports multiple toolchains listed below.

## Supported toolchains, assemblers, linkers, etc.

This package includes syntax highlighting for assembler directives, labels, etc. for the following toolchains:

Toolchain | Link | Platforms
----------|------|------
asm8080 | https://github.com/begoon/asm8080 | Linux, Windows, OS X
Pretty 8080 Assembler | https://github.com/svofski/pretty-8080-assembler | Web

I'm happy to add more assemblers as requested. Please use Github's issue function to report bugs or improvement ideas. Contributions are greatly appreciated!
